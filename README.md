## Gameplay
- **Rocket-Powered Propulsion**: Unlike traditional platformers, where jumping is the primary means of movement, Rocket Rider relies entirely on rocket-powered propulsion. Players must carefully time and aim their rocket blasts to move in any direction, making every move a calculated risk.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Course**: The game offers a variety of obstacle course designs, each more difficult than the last. Moving platforms, deadly traps, gravity-defying jumps, and other challenges await players.
- **Physics-Based Challenges**: The movement and behavior of the rocket-powered robot are governed by realistic physics. To effectively overcome the obstacles, players must master the nuances of momentum, trajectory, and timing.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: The game features a gradually increasing difficulty curve, allowing players to steadily improve their rocket riding skills. Rocket Rider keeps the action and challenge levels high with levels ranging from easy introductory levels to extremely complex challenges.
